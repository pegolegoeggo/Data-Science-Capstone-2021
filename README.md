Capstone project for the DS major, presented at Ruhlman 2021. 

<b> About the Data </b>

The data was collected using Twitter's Developer API in <a href="https://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/api.html"> Tweepy. </a> The columns contain information about when the Tweet was published, hashtags used, links referenced, and likes + retweet counts, but I mainly focused on the "text" column, which contained the tweets themselves, as a string.
