This woman didn‚Äôt commit suicide! #SandraBland #SayHerNameSandra Bland certainly doesn‚Äôt seem to be depressed and despondent in the video.

It‚Äôs outrageous that this video is only being released now. There must be accountability. It‚Äôs time Sandra‚Äôs family got justice. Reopen the investigation into her death now. #SayHerName@deray waiting to hear u discuss #SandraBland on @MSNBC #SayHerNameSandra Bland, I think of you often. I never met you. I never knew you. I think of your name and the dashcam footage. I am so glad to see the #SayHerName hashtag back. #SandraBland glad you filmed it! üò≠üò≠üò≠Why Black people need video footage to be believed? #SayHerName Sandra Bland#SandraBland #SayHerNameI'm going to share this again from his other account, because it's that good of a take. There's no doubt in my mind either Mr. Sanders #SayHerNameA 21st Century Lynching: Suppressed #SandraBland Video Comes to Light Shante Needham, one of her sisters, said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶they have an extremely, extremely good cover-up system.‚Äù #SayHerName#SandraBland. #SayHerName#SandraBland didn‚Äôt kill herself. I need y‚Äôall to get that. The police need oversight. Don‚Äôt tell anybody Black how to ‚Äòhandle‚Äô being stopped. We just don‚Äôt wanna die. And have that death be lied about. #SayHerName#sayhername@jemelehill @ZerlinaMaxwell #sayhernameSandra Bland, a 28-year-old African-American from Chicago, was taken into custody in Texas following the confrontational 2015 traffic stop and was found hanging in a jail cell three days later in what was officially ruled a suicide. #SayHerName@shaunking @wfaa I think it is safe to say EVERY BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA KNEW SHE WAS MURDERED. Now think about it. That cop knew he could pull that woman out of her car and disappear her and get away with it. #SayHerName Sandra we always knew what they did to you. Now the whole world knows.@KamalaHarris @JAllarie #SayHerNameThank you @AriMelber . Apparently America don't give a damn about the police brutality that is taking the lives of so many POC.

Another #SayHerName. #PamelaTurnerWhat's her name? I can't stomach the video atm. #SayHerName#SayHerName Pamela Turner should be alivePamela Turner was shot five times and killed by a police officer in Baytown, TX. Another murder by cops who escalate rather than de-escalate situations. #pamelaturner #sayhername #texas #news #police #baytown‚Ä¶The part that bothers me the most about this is that Pamela Turner clearly gave up defending her rights as a person and just took a frantic leap, knowing a man would likely respect an unborn child‚Äôs autonomy more than that of a black woman. #SayHerNameR.I.P. Pamela Shantay Turner. #SayHerNameThis is an appropriate picture of #PamelaTurner that her family released instead of what is currently depicted of her on news outlets. She was unarmed on the ground shot 5 times, killed by a Baytown, Texas Police Officer. #SayHerName #PamelaTurner üíî#SAYHERNAMEHorrifying. The women yells, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pregnant!‚Äù prior to being shot by cops.

That was obviously unnecessary police brutality.She MATTERED #SayHerName #PamelaShantayTurner#sayhername #PamelaTurner. And her unborn child.@SteveABC13 At least you pointed out that she was a mother, but why show her mugshot? As if a mugshot represents who she was. I'm sure her family would have provided a photo of her that better represents the truth. #KillerCops #SayHerName #BlackLivesMatter #SystemicRacismI have so much to say about Pamela Turner, the persistence of police killings, and American history. It all means something. I hope she and her family receives justice. She was loved #PamelaTurner #SayHerName #BlackLivesMatter #knowyourhistory@48hours It doesn't make her senseless murder any less tragic! She was a mother, grandmother, daughter, a HUMAN BEING! Why is it acceptable for police to slaughter people? What happened to due process? Who made police judge, jury, &amp; executioner?? #KillerCops #SayHerName #PamelaTurnerI can‚Äôt even say warning when I post this. I‚Äôm bawling crying right now after watching this. He had harassed her several times before this. And there will still be disgusting MF‚Äôers who will try to justify it. This is why we kneel. #PamelaTurner #SayHerName #sendhimtoprisonEven if she wasn't pregnant, it doesn't make her death any less tragic. The fact is, the cop didn't hesitate to end her life, even though she said she was pregnant. Didn't stop him from murdering her. #SystemicRacism #KillerCops #SayHerName #BlackLivesMatter #PamelaShantayTurner#PamelaTurner #SayHerName I‚Äôm so sorry that this has happened, I‚Äôm so sorry for the media‚Äôs portrayal of this I‚Äôm so sorry he was an officer that was employed under the pretence of keeping you safe #BlackLivesMatterWe say #BlackLivesMatter You say #AllLivesMatter but from all these lives only the black ones that don't mater enough.

From #EricGarner to #PamelaTurner #SayHerName, those who are killed are blamed for their own deaths. SHAME!Love this story! Well done India!

The fight to #EndCashBail is a life or death issue, particularly for Black trans women, nearly half of whom have been to prison as of 2011. #SayHerNameTiti Gulley was found hanging from a tree in a park in Portland, Oregon (USA) on 27 May 2019. The coroner ruled her death a suicide, but her family and friends believe she was murdered. She was 31. #SayHerName #TransLivesMatter #TDoR#RIPLayleenPolanco She did not need to die. If she could have afforded the $500 bail she we would be alive. If she were treated fairly while in jail, she would be alive. She died pretrial without being convicted of any crime. This is a disgrace. #SayHerName #EndCashBailThis may sound crazy, but last night's episode of @DatelineNBC is still on my mind. I will talk more about it on my upcoming video. #SayHerName #LaurenMcClusky #ForLauren #CampusSafetyRead more about Johana Medina Leon, who died at Otero detention facility after repeatedly requesting (and repeatedly being denied) medical care. #SayHerNameRead more about Roxsana Hernandez Rodriguez, who died in ICE custody on May 25, 2018.

GTFOH #AtatianaJefferson #SayHerNameThey were called to do a wellness check for #AtatianaJefferson but shot her dead through her own bedroom window instead. If an off-duty cop gets only 10 years for shooting a Black man in his pajamas in his own house, how much does an on-duty cop get for this? #SayHerNameWhy was #AtatianaJefferson's home approached by the police like a crime scene in action? Why were they skulking around the sides and back of her home unannounced? Why was she not given the courtesy of police identification and a knock on the front door? You know why. #SayHerNameMy heart is hurting &amp; my soul is tired. The police have the authority to do this, because WE give them that authority. It isn‚Äôt natural or god given. They will not stop killing us unless we MAKE them stop killing us. Period. #AtatianaJefferson #SayHerName #BlackLivesMatter@ava He has a very caring and rational line of reasoning. However, growing up, I knew that calling the police in some cases, would more than likely make a potentially bad situation far worse.

I believe there are tons of good cops, but we can‚Äôt allow these cops that just take the law into their own hands to continue being in our police departments and communities. #AtatianaJefferson #SayHerName@shaunking @MeritLaw #Ifuckedup is the only acceptable police response.

Condolences to this shattered family! ü•∫#AtatianaJefferson "Price promised a "complete and thorough investigation" to be conducted by Police Chief Ed Kraus, which will then be forwarded to the Tarrant County District Attorney Law Enforcement Incident Team." (sounds shady to me-js) #BlackLivesMatter #SayHerNameApparently black people need to add ‚ÄúBeing in their own house/apartment‚Äù as a way to also be murdered by police. Ridiculous. How many times do we have to see this before something happens with police reform? #AtatianaJefferson #SayHerNameI think the concept is better understood this way. If you're sitting at home playing video games w/ your nephew, do you have the expectation that an officer will come to your home &amp; kill you for no reason? You don't?

I give #NOFUCKS about any riot that may take place as a result of this shooting. Any injury or property damage will be a okay with me. #SAYHERNAME!What is it with Texas?!

In calling them, you are not always stopping an emergency, you‚Äôre often creating one. #AtatianaJefferson #AtatianaKoquiceJefferson #SayHerNameESPECIALLY if they are trans, bi+, gay, disabled, queer, women, neurodivergent, or POC -like Atatiana. #SayHerName #AtatianaJefferson400 years later and were still dying by the hands of white people.
